# 🎯 LoopCrash

> **Fire. Bounce. Reclaim. Survive.**  
> A fast, 2.5D top-down arcade loop — shoot arrows that ricochet off screen edges, collect them back, and use those same shots to wreck the chaos and chase a high score.

## 🎮 About

LoopCrash is a high-energy 2.5D top-down shooter where every arrow you fire becomes part of the loop: arrows bounce around the screen, you pick them up, and reuse them to damage enemies and survive for a high score. Built as a game-jam prototype with a lightweight Unity codebase.

---

## 🔥 Core Gameplay

- **Shoot** arrows — they bounce off the screen edges and keep moving.
- **Reclaim** arrows by picking them up to reload and continue the loop.
- **Use** recovered arrows to damage enemies and clear the area.
- **Survive** waves and chase a top score — risk collecting vs. dodging is the central loop.

---

## ✨ Features

- Looping projectile mechanic (arrows bounce off screen bounds)  
- Pickup / reuse ammo system — the same projectiles become your resource  
- Fast, arcade-style score chase  
- Minimal, jam-friendly codebase (Unity + C#) — easy to iterate on

---

## 🎛 Controls

- **Move:** `W A S D` or Left Stick  
- **Aim:** Mouse or Right Stick  
- **Shoot:** Left Click / RT / Primary Fire  
- **Reload:** R

*(Adjust these to the actual input mapping in your project.)*

## 💡 Ideas / Roadmap

- Arrow variants (explosive, split, homing)  
- Enemy variety & wave patterns  
- Powerups (speed, shield, temporary infinite arrows)  
- Polished UI, main menu, and local high score table  
- Mobile controls / controller support  
- Visual polish: particles, better shaders, and SFX
